## Creating Tableau Dashboard

In this project, I create an explanatory data visualization using Tableau Public from Prosper Loan dataset; explore the Prosper load market share distribution across USA, borrowers credit risk control, borrowers credit risk affecting factors and how Prosper bursting their market. In general, Prosper did not manage borrowers information well and struggled before 2009. In 2009, a Prosper rating system was introduced and market got recoverd. New risk control system made Prosper burst in 2013.
